# Japanese-Wii-Errors

This is a Wii Error Log that captures errors from Japanese Exclusive Channels that have been untranslated. 
If you found an error in any Japanese Exclusive Channel and untranslated, Please open a Pull Request so I can add it to the collection.

If you're trying to open a Pull Request, Make sure you have
- The Error untranslated (be sure to mark it as a type of error. (i.e "Internet Error", "Server Error"))
- Where you found the error (i.e "Demae Channel", "Wii no ma")
- Solution for that said Error
